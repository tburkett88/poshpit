# Filebox With Table

In this project, you'll practice your basic HTML and CSS. [This is your target.](https://filebox-with-table-target.herokuapp.com/landing)

Do your work in the `public` folder, and ignore everything else that you see. I've already created a file called `landing.html` for you to work in. Also, all of the images that you need are already in the `public` folder.

Good luck!
